# NGP

Next Generation Progrmaming, a programming language for mathematical and scientific computing.

### LLVM

LLVM-IR as the intermediate representation for the language. The idea was to also implement the compiler in C++, however in order to preserve sanity a direct C implementation was opted for.

### Note

Consider this to be a hobby project. Do not use it for anything serious at this point in time.
